## Content - 3 listening levels

We are used to be hearing all the time. Nowadays is rare to have a silence time. We want that sometimes, but we need to force us to have a time in silence. But hear is not listen. We have plenty of conversations all day, but we are not always listening in the same way. Usually 3 levels of listening are recognized.

**Level 1** is called *Internal listening*, **your awareness is on yourself. You listen to the words of the other person, but your attention is on what it means to you**. This happen when you are listening to the other person talking, but at the same time focusing in what is happening inside you. Example of this is when you are thinking on what are your ideas about what the other person is saying, or you are thinking in your answer or question. This is really common in interviews, some journalists begins to think in their next question, rather on the answer they are receiving.

**Level 2** is called *focused or active listening*, **where you have a sharp focus in the other person**, and not much awareness of the ourside world. Your opinions or ideas are far away, and you just try to understand the other person, what she is saying with words, but at the same time what she's saying in the gesture, posture, movements. You’re never thinking ahead to what you want to say next or what you’re going to ask. You stay with the person in this present moment, and trust that the conversation will take on a powerful flow of its own without you having to control it in one direction or another.

**Level 3** is called *global listening*, in this level you must be open and ready to listen for information that may not be directly observable. An example of this level is when you are giving a talk, and meanwhile your presentation advance, you are aware of what is happening on your audience, are they engaged? are they distracted? In a conversation, you also could be interested in know what is happening in the conversation itself, it's flowing?

### Activity - Using the 3 levels in your conversations

Once you know and are capable to distiguish between the levels, is a good time to try to exercise. The easiest way is to do it in your regular conversations with your family or co-workers. So, tomorrow, try to be conscious at the time of your conversations on these levels, and exercise *active listening* with someone. Did you noctice differences? Did they note differences when you listen in this mode?

## Content - Active listening

This is the main level for a Coach. You will be better with practice, conversation a conversation, being conscious of what you want. Here you will find some tips that will help you on develop this skill.

### Conversation techniques

* **Paraphrases** it's important not only listen, but to be sure that you understand what the other person is trying to say. In a multicultural environment like Mozilla, where we use English like the main language, but is not the mother language of the majority, it's more important. When you *paraphrases* the other person, you repeat with your own words what she said. The she will have the chance to agree or say it again until both are sure that statement was well understood.
* **Feeling reflections** ask what was she feeling at that time, try to understand not only what happened, but the effect that had in her.
* **Clarification** again, it's important that there's no doubts about what the other person is talking about. Ask as many clarification questions you need. If you don't understand a word or expression, ask. Questions about what you are talking makes you fell listened.
* **Neutral statements** Brief verbal responses that show the speaker that you are following the conversation.
* **Summaries** after big chunks of conversation, summarize what you heard, that will help to have a common ground.

### Body language

* **Look the person in the eye** this will show your interest to her, that you are committed to the task. At Mozilla sometimes we had to make online calls that make this step little more difficult. Find ways to show that you are there, full presence. If it's only an audio conversation, neutral statements are important for this part.
* **Use natural posture** there are some position that shows that you are not present. Try no to move too much, that you distract the pther person and make her feel you are bored. Sit up in your chair with your legs crossed or together.

### What not to do
* Interrupt the other person. Let her finnish the sentences.
* Arguing or opposing the other person point of view. You don't have to convince her of anything.
* Don't make judgements on her attitudes.
* Giving advice. The idea is to work together to find a solution.
* Jumping to conclusions. Remember that we are trying to understand the other person and how she is affected for the things that are happening.
