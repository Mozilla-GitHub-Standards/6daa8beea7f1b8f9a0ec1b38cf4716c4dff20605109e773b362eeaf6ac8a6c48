## GROW model at a glance

> [«Asking coaching questions – rather than telling – is the best way to mentally engage your coachee. And as you are looking for the highest possible engagement from your coachee, asking coaching questions therefore becomes your most important means of communication.»](https://jeroen-de-flander.com/grow-coaching-model-questions/) Jeroen De Flander

The GROW model is a way to ask the right questions qt the right order. There are other models in the world, but this model have the advantage of being simple and really well tested [since the time it was developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GROW_model). The name is an acronym:

* **G**: Goal for the session or a mid-term goal
* **R**: Reality, what is the current status, how far they are far away from their goal?
* **O**: Options, what are the options to change the current status and succeed on the goal
* **W**: Way forward, what are the next steps to advance in the goal.

### Goals

Goals needs to be setted by your coachee. Don't try to create it yourself or imposse it. Make open questions that will lead them to find the goal they want to solve (or work on it).

If you are working on mid-term goals, there are many ways to build it. You can use a system known by [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) to write it down once they found it.

* Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
* Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
* Achievable (agreed, attainable).
* Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
* Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

This way to build goals will help you in the other stages of the GROW model, and will be very helpful when you have to set the «way forward» part and how you will be measuring the work your coachee will be doing. Here are a few examples of questions that will help you at this stage:

* What is the aim of this discussion?
* What would you like to happen that is not happening now, or what would you like not to happen that is happening now?
* How much personal control or influence do you have over your goal?

### Reality

It's important at this stage to have a honest conversation. Ask questions to try to understand their perceived current reality. Don't try to have opinions about their opinion. Try to avoid their opinions too, and found in their answers the current status.
> As a coach, you should help your coachee to remove as many false assumptions as possible. (Jeroen De Flander)

Talking about the reality will make them beginning to think in possible solutions. Again, open questions will make the difference. Avoid to make questions that include your opinion or suggested answers. Some examples that could help you:

* What is happening now? What is the effect or result of this?
* How have you verified, or would you verify, that that is so?
* What is holding you back?

### Options

This is the phase to begin to think in ways to solve the problem. Ask them to think as many as they could, without thinking now on the chances to do it. As Jeroen De Flander says: «Your objective as a coach during this stage should help your coachee identify as many different ideas and solutions as possible.»

Try to create a long list rather than just the best idea. You will have time to work with them on finding the best one later. It's important to guide them in finding a direction, without actually making decisions for them. Some questions that will help you in this stage:

* What else could you do?
* What if this or that constraint were removed? Would that change things?
* What are the benefits and costs of each option?

### Way forward

This is the time when they will take some decisions. Your work here is that they take responsability and commit to actions. Now that you have the goal and the option to succed on this goal, is the time to transform it to actions that could be measure and followed in the next meeting.

What they can do from now to the next meeting to advance? How you will be measuring success in the next meeting? Some examples that will help you in this stage:

* So, what will you do now, and when? What else will you do?
* How can you keep yourself motivated?
* When precisely are you going to start and finish each action step?

End the meeting setting the time and date for the next reunion, when you will be checkin on the progress.

## How to be prepared before your meetings

* **Clear your mind** shut down your email or any other application or distraction to be fully immerse on your conversation.
* **Read your notes** from the last meeting to know where you left the conversation and what was supposed to happen between meetings.
* **Prepare to be constructive** remember to maintain eye contact and an open posture. Allow time for the other person to think and speak—don’t interrupt.
* **Prepare to give negative feedback if you must** think about it before, how you will be saying it. Focus on future effort.
* **Keep your emotions in check** it's normal to feel frustration when you're watching someone grow, but you must manage theses feelings privately.
* **Get your agenda straight** set your own goals for the session, focus yourself in your priorities.
